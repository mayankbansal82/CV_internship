# CV_internship

This repo represents the work I did in the final semester of my undergraduate as a Computer Vision intern at a robotics startup. I developed an object detection model using Yolov5 which can identify different classes of wastes(plastics, cardboards, etc) and deployed it on NVIDIA Jetson using TensorRT. I also developed a ResNet classification model to detect the colour of the waste and another classification model to tell if a PET bottle is crushed or not.

### Tools used
- PyTorch
- NVIDIA Jetson Xavier
- Google Colab
- AWS
- TensorRT

### Object Detection
An object detection model was developed using YoLov5 to detect different classes of wastes on a conveyor belt. The below images show the real-time result of the YoLov5 implementation on a NVIDIA Jetson Xavier.
